# Asteroids

This is a project from one of the undergraduate courses from California State University: Sacramento. I recently <br>
found it again and have decided to improve it over time to practice my Java skills. 

## About this project

This was the one project that really tested my ability to program in Java whilst utilizing various libraries. <br>
Back when I was still an undergraduate, my experience with Java was very limited, and so it was more of a case <br>
of simply programming a workable solution and if it worked, no further optimizations were performed. Of course, <br>
this is bad practice, and so I've gone ahead and started to clean up the code to make it more readable as well as <br>
adhering to more compliant code by utilizing the SonarLint plugin for the IntelliJ IDE. 

As mentioned previously, I have decided to improve my implementation of the Asteroids game over time, and I am <br>
picking up/learning many things that I wouldn't have otherwise. I hope the current and future commits to this <br>
repository can help showcase how much I've learned while working with Java and Git.
